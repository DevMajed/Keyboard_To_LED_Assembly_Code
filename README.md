# Keyboard to LED 

In this code, 4x4 keypad is used in order to control the tri-color LED.

Pushing each of the buttons 0-7 should light the LED with the color specified below.
When the button is released, the LED should remain lit
Pressing any of the other buttons (9,A,B,C,D,*,#) should not affect the LED

0:Black, 1:Blue, 2:Green, 3:Cyan, 4:Red, 5:Magenta, 6:Yellow, 7: White

Here is the steps to scan the keyboard and detect keypresses:
One time - Set all the bits connected to C3:C0 as inputs; set pull ups. Set all bits connected to R3:R0 as outputs
Loop (all values below in binary)
1. R3:R0 = 0111; Read C3:C0; based on value of C3:C0, keypress as follows:
0111=‘1’ 1011=‘2’ 1101=‘3’ 1110=‘A’ 1111=none
2. R3:R0 = 1011; Read C3:C0; based on value of C3:C0, keypress as follows:
0111=‘4’ 1011=‘5’ 1101=‘6’ 1110=‘B’ 1111=none
3. R3:R0 = 1101; Read C3:C0; based on value of C3:C0, keypress as follows:
0111=‘7’ 1011=‘8’ 1101=‘9’ 1110=‘C’ 1111=none
4. R3:R0 = 1110; Read C3:C0; based on value of C3:C0, keypress as follows:
0111=‘*’ 1011=‘0’ 1101=‘#’ 1110=‘D’ 1111=none
It is possible to read a value other than 0111,1011,1101,1110 if multiple keys are pressed simultaneously. we will ignore this condition
